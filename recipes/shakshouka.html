      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs.<br>
        It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It<br>
        is similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish huevos rancheros.
