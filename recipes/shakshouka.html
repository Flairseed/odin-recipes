    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs.<br>
      It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It<br>
      is similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish huevos rancheros.

        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir<br>
        until vegetables have softened and onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.

      <li>Meanwhile, mix together tomatoes, chile pepper, cumin, paprika, and salt in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Stir tomato mixture into onion mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until tomato juices have cooked off,<br>
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make 4 indentations in tomato mixture; crack eggs into indentations. Cover the skillet and cook<br>
        until eggs are firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.
